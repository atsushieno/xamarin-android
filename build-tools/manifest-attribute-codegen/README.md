# What is this?

manifest-attribute-codegen.exe is a simple tool that collects Android SDK
resource information about AndroidManifest.xml, then generate a unified
element/attribute definition with "which API introduced this" information.

With that, we can find what needs to be added to xamarin-android.

(Note that this tools is not for generating code, at least for now.)
